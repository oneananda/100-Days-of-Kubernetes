## Day 60: Kubernetes Advanced Networking — Network Policies for Security and Traffic Control

### 📘 Overview

Network Policies in Kubernetes allow you to control traffic flow at the pod level. This session focuses on creating and applying network policies to secure workloads and manage communication between pods and services.

---

### Objectives

1. Learn how network policies control traffic.
2. Create and test network policies for Kubernetes workloads.
3. Debug and monitor network policy behavior.

---

### Key Concepts

1. **Network Policies**:
   - Define rules for ingress and egress traffic.
   - Allow or restrict traffic between pods or external systems.

2. **Selectors**:
   - Use labels to specify the pods affected by the policy.

3. **Default Deny Policy**:
   - Block all traffic by default and explicitly allow required connections.
