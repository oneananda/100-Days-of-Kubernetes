## Day 46: Kubernetes Blue-Green Deployments — Practical Class

### 📘 Overview

**Blue-Green Deployment** is a release strategy that ensures zero downtime and rollback capabilities by running two environments simultaneously: the "blue" (current version) and "green" (new version). Traffic is switched from blue to green only after successful testing.

This session focuses on implementing Blue-Green Deployments in Kubernetes using Deployments, Services, and namespace isolation.

### Objectives

1. Understand the concept and benefits of Blue-Green Deployments.
2. Implement Blue-Green Deployments in Kubernetes.
3. Switch traffic between environments using Services.
4. Test rollback and downtime-free transitions.

### Key Concepts

1. **Blue-Green Deployment**:
   - Maintains two parallel environments for the current and new versions.
   - Ensures safe rollouts and instant rollbacks.

2. **Service Switching**:
   - Services are updated to route traffic to the desired environment.
   - No changes are made directly to deployments or pods during the transition.

3. **Namespace Isolation**:
   - Separate namespaces can be used to keep blue and green environments distinct.
