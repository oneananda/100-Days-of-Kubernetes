## Day 45: Kubernetes Canary Deployments — Practical Class

### 📘 Overview

A **Canary Deployment** is a progressive delivery strategy that allows you to release updates to a subset of users while monitoring the changes for potential issues. This method minimizes risk by gradually increasing traffic to the new version while ensuring stability for the majority of users.

This session focuses on implementing Canary Deployments in Kubernetes using Deployments and Services.

### Objectives

1. Understand the concept and benefits of Canary Deployments.
2. Configure Kubernetes Deployments for Canary releases.
3. Gradually shift traffic between versions using services.
4. Monitor the deployment to ensure stability.

### Key Concepts

1. **Canary Deployment**:
   - Gradual rollout of a new application version to a small subset of users.
   - Allows issues to be identified before full-scale deployment.

2. **Traffic Splitting**:
   - Directing a percentage of traffic to the new version.
   - Adjusted by scaling replicas or configuring ingress controllers.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Observing metrics and logs during the rollout to ensure the new version is stable.
