## Day 91: Kubernetes API Server Extensibility with Aggregated APIs

### 📘 Overview

Kubernetes is designed to be highly extensible, allowing you to add new functionalities without modifying its core. **API aggregation** enables you to extend the Kubernetes API server by seamlessly integrating additional API servers. This approach empowers you to introduce custom API groups and resources, effectively extending Kubernetes’ functionality to meet your unique requirements.

---


### Objectives

1. **Understand API Aggregation:**  
   - Learn the concept of API aggregation and its role in extending Kubernetes.
   
2. **Create and Manage Aggregated API Servers:**  
   - Develop a custom API server, deploy it, and register it with the Kubernetes API aggregator.
   
3. **Explore Use Cases:**  
   - Identify scenarios where extending Kubernetes with aggregated APIs can simplify custom integrations, provide specialized functionality, or enhance observability.

---

### Key Concepts

1. **API Aggregation:**  
   - **Definition:** The process of integrating one or more API servers into the core Kubernetes API server, so that clients can access both native and extended APIs via a single endpoint.
   - **Mechanism:** The Kubernetes API server acts as a proxy that routes requests for aggregated API groups to the corresponding custom API servers.

2. **Aggregated API Server Components:**  
   - **Custom API Server:** A standalone service that implements additional API endpoints.
   - **APIService Resource:** A Kubernetes resource that registers the custom API server with the core API server, specifying details such as the API group, version, and service location.

3. **Use Cases for Extending Kubernetes:**  
   - **Custom Resource Management:** Implement new resource types with specialized controllers.
   - **Enhanced Observability:** Expose additional metrics, dashboards, or business logic via custom endpoints.
   - **Multi-Tenancy & Security:** Integrate admission controllers or authentication layers tailored to specific organizational needs.

### Practical Exercises: Creating an Aggregated API Server

#### 1. Develop Your Custom API Server

##### Step 1: Create a Simple API Server
Develop a lightweight API server that exposes a custom endpoint. For example, create a simple HTTP server in Go or your preferred language that returns a JSON payload:
```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "net/http"
)

type Message struct {
    Text string `json:"text"`
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/healthz", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        msg := Message{Text: "Custom API Server is healthy!"}
        json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(msg)
    })
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
Compile and containerize this application to create an image that can be deployed in Kubernetes.

---

#### 2. Deploy Your Custom API Server

##### Step 1: Create a Kubernetes Service for Your API Server
Deploy the API server as a Kubernetes service. Create a deployment and service manifest:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: custom-api-server
  namespace: custom-api
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: custom-api-server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: custom-api-server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: custom-api-server
        image: your-dockerhub-username/custom-api-server:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: custom-api
  namespace: custom-api
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 443
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: custom-api-server
```
Apply the manifest:
```bash
kubectl apply -f custom-api-deployment.yaml
```

---

#### 3. Register the Aggregated API with Kubernetes

##### Step 1: Create an APIService Resource
Register your custom API server with the Kubernetes API aggregator by creating an APIService manifest:
```yaml
apiVersion: apiregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: APIService
metadata:
  name: v1.custom.example.com
spec:
  service:
    name: custom-api
    namespace: custom-api
  group: custom.example.com
  version: v1
  insecureSkipTLSVerify: true
  groupPriorityMinimum: 1000
  versionPriority: 15
```
Apply the APIService resource:
```bash
kubectl apply -f apiservice.yaml
```

##### Step 2: Verify Aggregation
Test the aggregated API by querying it through the Kubernetes API server:
```bash
kubectl get --raw /apis/custom.example.com/v1/healthz
```
You should see the JSON output from your custom API server.

### Best Practices for Aggregated APIs

1. **Security:**  
   - Secure communication between the Kubernetes API aggregator and your custom API server, preferably using TLS certificates instead of `insecureSkipTLSVerify`.

2. **Scalability and Monitoring:**  
   - Ensure your custom API server is horizontally scalable and integrated with logging and monitoring solutions.

3. **Versioning and Compatibility:**  
   - Maintain clear versioning for your custom API and follow semantic versioning practices to manage backward compatibility.

4. **Documentation:**  
   - Document the API endpoints and their use cases thoroughly to facilitate adoption and maintenance.

5. **Testing:**  
   - Rigorously test the aggregated API in staging environments before deploying to production to ensure stability and reliability.
