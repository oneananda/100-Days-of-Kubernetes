## Day 90: Kubernetes Immutable Infrastructure with GitOps

### 📘 Overview

In this session, you'll explore how GitOps transforms Kubernetes infrastructure management by treating configurations as immutable code. Leveraging tools like **ArgoCD** and **Flux**, you can automate deployment pipelines, ensure consistency across environments, and maintain a clear audit trail of every change. This session covers implementing GitOps workflows, managing Kubernetes configurations as code, and adopting best practices for CI/CD pipelines in GitOps-driven environments.

### Objectives

1. **Implement GitOps with ArgoCD and Flux:**  
   - Learn how to set up and configure GitOps tools to automate and manage Kubernetes deployments.

2. **Manage Configurations as Code:**  
   - Treat infrastructure and application configurations as version-controlled code for consistency and auditability.

3. **Optimize CI/CD Pipelines:**  
   - Integrate best practices in CI/CD workflows to enhance the reliability and repeatability of deployments in a GitOps framework.

### Key Concepts

1. **GitOps:**  
   - A methodology that uses Git repositories as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application configurations.
   - Enables automated synchronization of desired state with the actual state in Kubernetes clusters.

2. **Immutable Infrastructure:**  
   - Once deployed, infrastructure components (e.g., container images, Kubernetes manifests) are not altered. Instead, any change is applied by replacing the component.
   - Enhances reliability, consistency, and traceability.

3. **GitOps Tools:**  
   - **ArgoCD:** A declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that automates deployment and synchronization of Kubernetes manifests.
   - **Flux:** A set of continuous and progressive delivery solutions for Kubernetes that ensure cluster configurations are always up-to-date with a Git repository.

4. **CI/CD Pipelines in GitOps:**  
   - Automated pipelines that build, test, and deploy code changes, while automatically updating Git repositories with the desired state for your cluster.
