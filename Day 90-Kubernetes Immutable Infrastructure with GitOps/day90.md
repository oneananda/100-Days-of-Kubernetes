## Day 90: Kubernetes Immutable Infrastructure with GitOps

### 📘 Overview

In this session, you'll explore how GitOps transforms Kubernetes infrastructure management by treating configurations as immutable code. Leveraging tools like **ArgoCD** and **Flux**, you can automate deployment pipelines, ensure consistency across environments, and maintain a clear audit trail of every change. This session covers implementing GitOps workflows, managing Kubernetes configurations as code, and adopting best practices for CI/CD pipelines in GitOps-driven environments.
