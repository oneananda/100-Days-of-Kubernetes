## Day 49: Kubernetes Jobs and CronJobs — Advanced Usage Practical Class

### 📘 Overview

**Jobs** and **CronJobs** in Kubernetes are used to execute tasks that run to completion or on a scheduled basis. They are ideal for batch processing, data backups, or periodic tasks. This session focuses on advanced usage of Jobs and CronJobs, including parallelism, retries, and handling failures.

---

### Objectives

1. Understand advanced configurations for Jobs and CronJobs.
2. Configure parallelism and completion settings for Jobs.
3. Schedule periodic tasks using CronJobs.
4. Handle retries and failure scenarios effectively.

---

### Key Concepts

1. **Jobs**:
   - Ensure that a specified number of tasks are successfully completed.
   - Support parallel execution for batch processing.

2. **CronJobs**:
   - Schedule Jobs to run at specific intervals.
   - Use cron syntax to define schedules.

3. **Retries and Timeouts**:
   - Configure retry limits and active deadlines for failure handling.

4. **Concurrency Policies**:
   - **Allow**: Run multiple instances concurrently.
   - **Forbid**: Ensure only one instance runs at a time.
   - **Replace**: Stop the currently running instance before starting a new one.
