## Day 49: Kubernetes Jobs and CronJobs — Advanced Usage Practical Class

### 📘 Overview

**Jobs** and **CronJobs** in Kubernetes are used to execute tasks that run to completion or on a scheduled basis. They are ideal for batch processing, data backups, or periodic tasks. This session focuses on advanced usage of Jobs and CronJobs, including parallelism, retries, and handling failures.

---

### Objectives

1. Understand advanced configurations for Jobs and CronJobs.
2. Configure parallelism and completion settings for Jobs.
3. Schedule periodic tasks using CronJobs.
4. Handle retries and failure scenarios effectively.

---

### Key Concepts

1. **Jobs**:
   - Ensure that a specified number of tasks are successfully completed.
   - Support parallel execution for batch processing.

2. **CronJobs**:
   - Schedule Jobs to run at specific intervals.
   - Use cron syntax to define schedules.

3. **Retries and Timeouts**:
   - Configure retry limits and active deadlines for failure handling.

4. **Concurrency Policies**:
   - **Allow**: Run multiple instances concurrently.
   - **Forbid**: Ensure only one instance runs at a time.
   - **Replace**: Stop the currently running instance before starting a new one.

### Practical Exercises

### 1. Creating a Job with Parallelism

#### Step 1: Define a Job
Create a `job-parallel.yaml` file:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: parallel-job
spec:
  completions: 5
  parallelism: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: worker
        image: busybox
        command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Processing task $(hostname) && sleep 5"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

Apply the Job:
```bash
kubectl apply -f job-parallel.yaml
```

Verify the Job and pods:
```bash
kubectl get jobs
kubectl get pods
```

Observe the parallel execution of tasks:
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

---

### 2. Handling Failures and Retries in Jobs

#### Step 1: Simulate a Failing Job
Create a `job-failing.yaml` file:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: failing-job
spec:
  backoffLimit: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: failing-worker
        image: busybox
        command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Simulating failure && exit 1"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

Apply the Job:
```bash
kubectl apply -f job-failing.yaml
```

Monitor retries and failure status:
```bash
kubectl get jobs
kubectl describe job failing-job
```

---

### 3. Scheduling Tasks with CronJobs

#### Step 1: Define a CronJob
Create a `cronjob-example.yaml` file:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: periodic-task
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *" # Runs every minute
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: periodic-worker
            image: busybox
            command: ["sh", "-c", "date; echo Hello from Kubernetes"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

Apply the CronJob:
```bash
kubectl apply -f cronjob-example.yaml
```

Verify the CronJob and Jobs it creates:
```bash
kubectl get cronjobs
kubectl get jobs
```

---

### 4. Configuring Concurrency Policies for CronJobs

#### Step 1: Update the CronJob
Modify the CronJob to use the `Forbid` concurrency policy:
```yaml
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: periodic-worker
            image: busybox
            command: ["sh", "-c", "sleep 120; echo Completed"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

Apply the updated CronJob:
```bash
kubectl apply -f cronjob-example.yaml
```

Observe that only one instance runs at a time:
```bash
kubectl get jobs
```

---

### 5. Cleanup

Remove all resources:
```bash
kubectl delete -f job-parallel.yaml
kubectl delete -f job-failing.yaml
kubectl delete -f cronjob-example.yaml
```

---

### Best Practices for Jobs and CronJobs

1. **Resource Limits**:
   - Set resource requests and limits to avoid overloading the cluster.

2. **Retries and Timeouts**:
   - Use `backoffLimit` and `activeDeadlineSeconds` to handle stuck or failing tasks.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor Job and CronJob status using tools like Prometheus or Kubernetes events.

4. **Concurrency Policies**:
   - Choose the appropriate policy (`Allow`, `Forbid`, `Replace`) for your use case.

5. **Logging**:
   - Centralize logs for better debugging and analysis of Job executions.

### 📝 Document Your Progress

In your `day49.md` file, record:
- Steps for creating and testing Jobs and CronJobs.
- Observations on parallelism, retries, and concurrency policies.
- Challenges faced and their resolutions.
- Examples of real-world use cases for Jobs and CronJobs.

---

### 🎯 Outcome for Day 49

By the end of Day 49, you should:
1. Configure advanced Job settings like parallelism and retries.
2. Schedule periodic tasks using CronJobs.
3. Handle failure scenarios effectively with retries and backoff limits.
4. Apply concurrency policies to manage task execution.
