## Day 70: Kubernetes Gateway API — The Future of Ingress and Service Mesh Integration

### 📘 Overview

The **Kubernetes Gateway API** is the next evolution of networking APIs, offering a more flexible, extensible, and expressive alternative to the traditional **Ingress API**. It is designed to unify ingress, egress, and service mesh routing under a common standard. This session introduces the Gateway API, compares it with Ingress, and demonstrates how to integrate it with service meshes like **Istio** and **Linkerd**.

---

### Objectives

1. Understand the fundamentals of the Kubernetes Gateway API.  
2. Compare the Gateway API with the traditional Ingress API.  
3. Learn how to configure **GatewayClasses**, **Gateways**, and **Routes**.  
4. Integrate the Gateway API with service meshes like **Istio** and **Linkerd**.  

---

### Key Concepts

1. **Gateway API**:  
   - A set of CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) that standardize networking for ingress, egress, and service mesh routing.  

2. **GatewayClass**:  
   - Defines the infrastructure-level configuration and behavior for Gateways. Similar to StorageClass for storage.  

3. **Gateway**:  
   - Represents a network endpoint (like a load balancer) that routes traffic to services.  

4. **Routes (HTTPRoute, TCPRoute, etc.)**:  
   - Define how traffic is routed from the Gateway to Kubernetes services based on protocols and rules.  

5. **Ingress vs. Gateway API**:  
   - Gateway API provides more advanced routing, cross-namespace support, and better extensibility than Ingress.
