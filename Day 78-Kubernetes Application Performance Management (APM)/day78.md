## Day 78: Kubernetes Application Performance Management (APM)

### 📘 Overview

Application Performance Management (APM) is essential for monitoring and optimizing the performance of distributed applications running on Kubernetes. Tools like **Jaeger**, **OpenTelemetry**, and **Elastic APM** provide distributed tracing and detailed insights into application behavior. This session focuses on setting up APM tools, monitoring application performance, and identifying bottlenecks in Kubernetes.

---


### Objectives

1. Understand the role of APM tools like Jaeger, OpenTelemetry, and Elastic APM in Kubernetes.  
2. Set up distributed tracing for monitoring application performance.  
3. Debug performance slowdowns and identify bottlenecks in distributed systems.

### Key Concepts

1. **Application Performance Management (APM):**  
   - Tools and practices used to monitor, diagnose, and optimize application performance in real time.  

2. **Distributed Tracing:**  
   - Tracks requests as they traverse multiple services in a distributed system.  

3. **Key APM Tools:**  
   - **Jaeger:** An open-source tool for end-to-end distributed tracing.  
   - **OpenTelemetry:** A framework for generating and exporting telemetry data like metrics, logs, and traces.  
   - **Elastic APM:** Provides full-stack observability, including tracing, metrics, and logs.
