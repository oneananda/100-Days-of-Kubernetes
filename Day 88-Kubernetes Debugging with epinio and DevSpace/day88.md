## Day 88: Kubernetes Debugging with epinio and DevSpace

### 📘 Overview

In this session, you'll explore how to accelerate your development cycles by combining **epinio** and **DevSpace**. Epinio simplifies application deployment on Kubernetes, allowing for rapid iterations, while DevSpace empowers you to debug live applications with ease. Together, these tools streamline local Kubernetes development workflows, enabling you to quickly develop, test, and debug your applications in a real Kubernetes environment.

### Objectives

1. **Rapid Deployment:** Learn to use epinio for fast and efficient application deployment on Kubernetes.
2. **Live Debugging:** Leverage DevSpace to debug and monitor live applications running in your cluster.
3. **Streamlined Workflows:** Simplify local Kubernetes development by integrating deployment and debugging tools into a seamless workflow.

### Key Concepts

1. **Epinio:**  
   - A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) tool designed to abstract away the complexities of Kubernetes deployment.
   - Enables developers to push code directly to Kubernetes without managing intricate configuration details.

2. **DevSpace:**  
   - A development and debugging tool that allows you to work on live applications in Kubernetes.
   - Supports hot reloading, real-time log streaming, and remote debugging to accelerate the development process.

3. **Local Kubernetes Development:**  
   - Combines rapid deployment and live debugging to create an efficient iterative development process.
   - Helps bridge the gap between local code changes and their impact on running applications in Kubernetes.
