## Day 93: Kubernetes Advanced Traffic Management with Service Mesh

### 📘 Overview

Service meshes have revolutionized the way microservices communicate in Kubernetes by providing advanced traffic management, enhanced security, and observability. In this session, we compare popular service mesh implementations—**Istio**, **Linkerd**, and **Consul**—and dive into advanced traffic routing and load balancing techniques. We will also explore securing service-to-service communication using mutual TLS (mTLS) and testing resilience through fault injection.
