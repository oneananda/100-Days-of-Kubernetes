## Day 54: Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler — Practical Class

### 📘 Overview

The **Cluster Autoscaler** in Kubernetes automatically adjusts the size of a cluster by adding or removing nodes based on resource demands. It ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining workload performance.

This session focuses on configuring the Cluster Autoscaler, testing its scaling behavior, and understanding its integration with cloud providers.

---

### Objectives

1. Understand the purpose and functionality of the Cluster Autoscaler.
2. Configure the Cluster Autoscaler for a Kubernetes cluster.
3. Simulate workloads to trigger scaling events.
4. Monitor and analyze the scaling behavior of the Cluster Autoscaler.

### Key Concepts

1. **Cluster Autoscaler**:
   - Automatically adjusts the number of nodes in a cluster.
   - Scales up when there are pending pods that cannot be scheduled due to insufficient resources.
   - Scales down when nodes are underutilized and pods can be rescheduled on other nodes.

2. **Cloud Provider Integration**:
   - Works with managed Kubernetes services like AWS EKS, Google GKE, and Azure AKS.

3. **Node Groups**:
   - Logical grouping of nodes for scaling operations.

4. **Scaling Policies**:
   - Configurable thresholds for scaling up and scaling down nodes.
