# 100 Days of Kubernetes

Welcome to the **100 Days of Kubernetes** challenge! This repository is a journey through Kubernetes, where I'll be learning and practicing Kubernetes concepts, tools, and best practices every day for 100 days. Follow along as I document each dayâ€™s progress, share insights, and build hands-on projects!

## Why 100 Days of Kubernetes?

Kubernetes has become the go-to platform for managing containerized applications at scale. This challenge is designed to deepen my understanding of Kubernetes, improve my practical skills, and build a repository of knowledge that others can use to kickstart their own Kubernetes journey.

## Challenge Goals

1. **Understand Core Concepts**: Master the fundamentals of Kubernetes, including Pods, Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps.
2. **Dive Into Advanced Topics**: Explore more complex topics like networking, storage, monitoring, and security within Kubernetes.
3. **Hands-On Practice**: Create and manage clusters, deploy real-world applications, and troubleshoot issues.
4. **Document Everything**: Share daily progress, code snippets, and useful insights to make this repository a learning resource for others.
5. **Build Projects**: Complete several projects using Kubernetes to solidify knowledge and create a portfolio of practical applications.

## Daily Log

Each day, I will document my progress here. Follow along to see what I'm learning and working on!
