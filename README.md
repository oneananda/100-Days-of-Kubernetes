# 100 Days of Kubernetes

Welcome to the **100 Days of Kubernetes** challenge! This repository is a journey through Kubernetes, where I'll be learning and practicing Kubernetes concepts, tools, and best practices every day for 100 days. Follow along as I document each dayâ€™s progress, share insights, and build hands-on projects!

## Why 100 Days of Kubernetes?

Kubernetes has become the go-to platform for managing containerized applications at scale. This challenge is designed to deepen my understanding of Kubernetes, improve my practical skills, and build a repository of knowledge that others can use to kickstart their own Kubernetes journey.
