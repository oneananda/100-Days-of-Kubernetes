## Day 2: Understanding Kubernetes Architecture (Master and Node Components)

### 📘 Overview

Kubernetes architecture is designed to ensure high availability, scalability, and resilience for containerized applications. It consists of a **control plane** (often referred to as the master) and **worker nodes** that run workloads. Understanding this architecture is key to managing Kubernetes clusters effectively, as each component in the system plays a unique role in coordinating and executing workloads.

---

### Kubernetes Cluster Structure

A Kubernetes cluster consists of two primary components:

1. **Control Plane (Master)**: Manages the overall state of the cluster, making high-level decisions and scheduling workloads.
2. **Worker Nodes**: Hosts the application workloads, running containers organized within Pods.

---

### 1. Control Plane Components

The control plane, or the "master" in Kubernetes, manages and maintains the cluster state, controlling the lifecycle of applications and resources. Key components include:

#### a. **API Server (`kube-apiserver`)**
   - The **central management point** for the Kubernetes cluster.
   - It exposes the Kubernetes API, which is how the cluster is managed and configured.
   - All communication, both internal and external, happens through the API Server.
   - **Command** to interact with the API server: `kubectl` (e.g., `kubectl get nodes`).

#### b. **etcd**
   - A **distributed key-value store** that holds the entire cluster’s state.
   - Every change in the cluster, like creating a pod or updating configurations, is recorded here.
   - Highly available and reliable, etcd ensures the cluster’s consistency and durability.

#### c. **Controller Manager (`kube-controller-manager`)**
   - Runs **multiple controllers** that handle routine cluster activities and ensure the desired state.
   - Types of controllers include:
     - **Node Controller**: Monitors and responds to the health of nodes.
     - **Replication Controller**: Ensures that the correct number of pod replicas is running.
     - **Endpoints Controller**: Manages endpoint objects for services.
   - Controllers continuously monitor the cluster to ensure desired state matches actual state.

#### d. **Scheduler (`kube-scheduler`)**
   - **Assigns workloads** (pods) to available worker nodes.
   - Considers resource requirements, such as CPU and memory, to place each pod on the most appropriate node.
   - Ensures balanced and optimized resource allocation across nodes in the cluster.

---

### 2. Worker Node Components

Worker nodes are where application workloads actually run. Each node contains components that ensure proper execution and health of workloads.

#### a. **Kubelet**
   - An **agent** running on every worker node.
   - Responsible for communicating with the API server and ensuring that containers are running as instructed by the control plane.
   - Manages pod lifecycle, monitors health, and reports status back to the control plane.

#### b. **Kube-proxy**
   - Maintains **networking rules** on nodes.
   - Enables communication within the cluster (pods-to-pods) and externally (exposing services outside the cluster).
   - Ensures that network requests are directed to the correct pod(s) based on service definitions.

#### c. **Container Runtime**
   - The underlying software that actually runs containers.
   - Common choices include **Docker**, **containerd**, and **CRI-O**.
   - Kubernetes is runtime-agnostic, meaning you can choose the best runtime for your use case.

### 📋 Diagram of Kubernetes Architecture

Here's a basic diagram of Kubernetes architecture to visualize how components interact:
