## Day 64: Kubernetes Advanced Scheduling — Taints, Tolerations, and Pod Topology Spread Constraints

### 📘 Overview

This session combines **taints and tolerations** with **pod topology spread constraints** to provide granular control over pod scheduling. These features are essential for managing resource isolation, high availability, and efficient workload distribution in Kubernetes clusters.

---

### Objectives

1. Understand how taints and tolerations influence pod scheduling.
2. Learn how pod topology spread constraints distribute workloads across the cluster.
3. Combine these techniques for advanced scheduling use cases.

---

### Key Concepts

1. **Taints and Tolerations**:
   - **Taints** prevent pods from being scheduled on certain nodes unless they tolerate the taint.
   - **Tolerations** allow pods to bypass taints and be scheduled on tainted nodes.

2. **Pod Topology Spread Constraints**:
   - Control how pods are distributed across nodes, zones, or regions.
   - Ensure even workload distribution or isolation across failure domains.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - Resource isolation for specific workloads.
   - High availability through pod distribution across failure zones.
