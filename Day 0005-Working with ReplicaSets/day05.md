## Day 5: Working with ReplicaSets — Ensuring High Availability

### 📘 Overview

A **ReplicaSet** is a Kubernetes object that ensures a specified number of identical Pods are always running in a cluster. It's a key concept for maintaining **high availability** and **fault tolerance**. Understanding ReplicaSets is essential for deploying resilient applications.

---

### What is a ReplicaSet?

- A ReplicaSet helps maintain a **stable set of pod replicas** running at any time.
- It automatically replaces any Pods that fail or are terminated to maintain the desired count.
- ReplicaSets allow applications to be **highly available** and **scalable** by managing multiple instances of Pods.

---

### Key Characteristics of ReplicaSets

1. **Desired Replicas**: The number of Pods a ReplicaSet should manage.
2. **Selector**: Matches labels on Pods to identify which Pods the ReplicaSet is responsible for.
3. **Pod Template**: Specifies the configuration for Pods (e.g., container image, resources) the ReplicaSet manages.
4. **Automatic Scaling**: Although manual by default, ReplicaSets can be scaled by changing the `replicas` value.

---

### Hands-On with ReplicaSets

In this section, we’ll explore creating, managing, and scaling ReplicaSets using `kubectl` commands.

---

### 1. Creating ReplicaSets

You can define a ReplicaSet in a YAML manifest file, specifying the desired replica count, Pod template, and selectors.

#### Example: ReplicaSet YAML Configuration

This example configures a ReplicaSet to maintain **three replicas** of an Nginx Pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-replicaset
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Save this file as `nginx-replicaset.yaml` and create the ReplicaSet with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-replicaset.yaml
```

- This command creates a ReplicaSet named `nginx-replicaset` that will maintain three replicas of an Nginx container.

---

### 2. Inspecting ReplicaSets

Once created, you can view the ReplicaSet’s status and its managed Pods with various `kubectl` commands.

#### View ReplicaSets
```bash
kubectl get rs
```

This command lists all ReplicaSets, showing their desired, current, and ready replica counts.

#### Describe a ReplicaSet
```bash
kubectl describe rs nginx-replicaset
```

This command provides details about the ReplicaSet, including:
- Events related to the creation and management of Pods.
- Status of each replica and error messages, if any.

#### View Pods Created by the ReplicaSet
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
```

This lists all Pods with the `app=nginx` label, which are managed by the ReplicaSet.

---

### 3. Scaling ReplicaSets

To increase or decrease the number of replicas, modify the `replicas` value in the YAML file or use the `kubectl scale` command.

#### Example: Scaling with kubectl

```bash
kubectl scale rs nginx-replicaset --replicas=5
```

This command increases the replica count to 5. Kubernetes automatically adds new Pods to match the desired count.

---

### 4. Deleting ReplicaSets

You can delete a ReplicaSet using the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete rs nginx-replicaset
```

If a ReplicaSet is deleted, all the Pods it manages are also deleted unless they are orphaned by changing the `orphanDependents` policy.

---

### Understanding ReplicaSet Lifecycle

- ReplicaSets are **persistent** as long as the desired replica count is greater than zero.
- When a Pod crashes, the ReplicaSet detects this and **automatically recreates the Pod** to maintain the desired state.
- If a node hosting a replica goes down, Kubernetes **reschedules** Pods on other available nodes, ensuring high availability.

---

### Hands-On Practice

1. **Create a ReplicaSet**: Define and apply a ReplicaSet YAML file for an Nginx application.
2. **Inspect the ReplicaSet**: Use `kubectl get rs` and `kubectl describe rs` to observe its properties.
3. **Scale the ReplicaSet**: Increase the replica count and confirm new Pods are created.
4. **Delete the ReplicaSet**: Remove the ReplicaSet and observe Pod termination.

---

### 📝 Document Your Progress

In your `day05.md` file, record:
- The commands you used to create, inspect, and scale ReplicaSets.
- Observations on how the ReplicaSet manages Pod replicas.
- Notes on troubleshooting or challenges faced.

---

### 🎯 Outcome for Day 5

By the end of Day 5, you should:
1. Understand how ReplicaSets ensure high availability.
2. Be able to create, inspect, and scale ReplicaSets using `kubectl`.
3. Recognize the advantages of using ReplicaSets for fault tolerance.
