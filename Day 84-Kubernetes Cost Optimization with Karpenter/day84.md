## Day 84: Kubernetes Cost Optimization with Karpenter  

### 📘 Overview  

Optimizing costs in Kubernetes clusters is crucial for efficient resource utilization. **Karpenter**, an open-source cluster autoscaler, dynamically provisions right-sized compute resources to meet application demands while minimizing costs. This session focuses on installing Karpenter, configuring it for workload-based scaling, and implementing cost-efficient node management strategies.
