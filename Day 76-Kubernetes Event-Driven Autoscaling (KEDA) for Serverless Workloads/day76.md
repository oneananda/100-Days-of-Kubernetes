## Day 76: Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA) for Serverless Workloads

### 📘 Overview

**Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA)** extends Kubernetes' native scaling capabilities by enabling event-driven autoscaling. KEDA allows workloads to scale based on metrics from external event sources like **Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**, and **Azure Queue**, making it an ideal solution for building serverless architectures on Kubernetes.

---

### Objectives

1. Understand the role of KEDA in enabling event-driven scaling.  
2. Learn to set up KEDA in a Kubernetes cluster.  
3. Scale workloads dynamically based on external event sources.  
4. Explore use cases for serverless architectures in Kubernetes.  

---

### Key Concepts

1. **KEDA:**  
   - A Kubernetes-based solution for event-driven autoscaling.  
   - Monitors event sources and scales workloads based on custom metrics.  

2. **Event Sources:**  
   - Includes Kafka, RabbitMQ, Azure Queue, AWS SQS, Prometheus, and more.  

3. **Serverless Workloads:**  
   - Workloads that scale to zero during inactivity and dynamically scale when events are received.
