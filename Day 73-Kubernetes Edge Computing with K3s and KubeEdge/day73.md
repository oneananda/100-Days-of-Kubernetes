## Day 73: Kubernetes Edge Computing with K3s and KubeEdge

### 📘 Overview

**Edge computing** brings compute, storage, and networking resources closer to end-users and devices, reducing latency and improving performance for real-time applications. Lightweight Kubernetes distributions like **K3s** and frameworks like **KubeEdge** enable Kubernetes to run efficiently on edge devices. This session covers deploying K3s for edge computing, introducing KubeEdge for IoT workloads, and managing edge nodes with intermittent connectivity.

---

### Objectives

1. Deploy lightweight Kubernetes clusters using **K3s** for edge devices.  
2. Understand **KubeEdge** and its role in managing IoT workloads.  
3. Manage edge nodes and handle intermittent connectivity between cloud and edge clusters.

### Key Concepts

1. **K3s:**  
   - A lightweight, production-grade Kubernetes distribution designed for IoT and edge computing.  
   - Simplified deployment with a reduced resource footprint.  

2. **KubeEdge:**  
   - Extends Kubernetes to edge devices, enabling deployment and management of workloads on edge nodes.  
   - Supports offline operation and edge-cloud synchronization.  

3. **Edge Node Management:**  
   - Techniques for managing and monitoring edge nodes, especially in environments with unreliable network connections.
