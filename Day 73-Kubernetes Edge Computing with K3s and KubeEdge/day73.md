## Day 73: Kubernetes Edge Computing with K3s and KubeEdge

### 📘 Overview

**Edge computing** brings compute, storage, and networking resources closer to end-users and devices, reducing latency and improving performance for real-time applications. Lightweight Kubernetes distributions like **K3s** and frameworks like **KubeEdge** enable Kubernetes to run efficiently on edge devices. This session covers deploying K3s for edge computing, introducing KubeEdge for IoT workloads, and managing edge nodes with intermittent connectivity.
