Day 68: Kubernetes Advanced Scheduling — Combining Techniques for Optimized Workloads

📘 Overview

To fully leverage Kubernetes' scheduling capabilities, it’s essential to combine multiple advanced scheduling techniques. This session focuses on integrating Node Affinity, Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity, Taints and Tolerations, Priority Classes, Preemption, and Topology Spread Constraints to build efficient, resilient, and optimized workloads.


---

### Objectives

1. Learn how to combine multiple scheduling strategies for better workload placement.
2. Optimize resource utilization while ensuring high availability and performance.
3. Apply best practices for real-world scenarios in multi-tenant clusters.

---

### Key Concepts

1. Multi-Constraint Scheduling: Apply multiple scheduling techniques simultaneously for more controlled workload placement.
2. Workload Isolation and Distribution: Isolate critical workloads using taints and tolerations, while balancing pods using topology spread constraints.
3. Prioritized Scheduling: Assign priorities to critical workloads with priority classes and use preemption to reclaim resources.
4. Affinity for Performance: Use pod and node affinity to colocate or distribute pods for performance optimization.
