## Day 82: Kubernetes Runtime Security with Falco

### 📘 Overview

Kubernetes runtime security ensures that your cluster and workloads are protected against threats during their operation. **Falco**, a CNCF project, is a powerful open-source runtime security tool that detects unexpected or malicious behavior in your Kubernetes environment. This session focuses on understanding runtime threats, setting up Falco for threat detection, and creating custom rules for enhanced container security.
