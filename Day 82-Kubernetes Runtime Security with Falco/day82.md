## Day 82: Kubernetes Runtime Security with Falco

### 📘 Overview

Kubernetes runtime security ensures that your cluster and workloads are protected against threats during their operation. **Falco**, a CNCF project, is a powerful open-source runtime security tool that detects unexpected or malicious behavior in your Kubernetes environment. This session focuses on understanding runtime threats, setting up Falco for threat detection, and creating custom rules for enhanced container security.

---


### Objectives

1. Understand the common runtime threats in Kubernetes environments.  
2. Install and configure Falco to detect suspicious behavior.  
3. Write custom Falco rules to secure containers effectively.  

---

### Key Concepts

1. **Runtime Security:**  
   - Protects containers and workloads from malicious activities while they are running.  

2. **Falco:**  
   - An open-source runtime security tool that uses system calls to detect unexpected behavior.  

3. **Custom Rules:**  
   - User-defined rules in Falco to monitor specific security policies and detect anomalies.

### Practical Exercises: Kubernetes Runtime Security with Falco

---

#### 1. Understanding Kubernetes Runtime Threats

##### Common Runtime Threats:
- Privilege escalations in containers.  
- Unexpected file modifications or access.  
- Unauthorized network connections.  
- Execution of suspicious commands like shell access (`bash`, `sh`).  
- Access to sensitive host system resources.  

---

#### 2. Installing and Configuring Falco

##### Step 1: Install Falco
Install Falco using Helm:
```bash
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
helm repo update
helm install falco falcosecurity/falco --namespace falco --create-namespace
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n falco
```

##### Step 2: Enable Kubernetes Audit Logging
Falco can monitor Kubernetes audit logs for API server events. Enable audit logging by updating your API server configuration to include:
```yaml
--audit-log-path=/var/log/kubernetes/audit.log
--audit-policy-file=/etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml
```

Create an audit policy file:
```yaml
apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
rules:
  - level: Metadata
```

---

#### 3. Writing Custom Falco Rules

##### Step 1: Understand Default Rules
Falco comes with default rules to detect common threats. View them:
```bash
cat /etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml
```

##### Step 2: Write a Custom Rule
Create a rule to detect sensitive file access:
```yaml
- rule: Access to Sensitive Files
  desc: Detect access to critical files like /etc/shadow or /etc/passwd
  condition: open_read and (fd.name = "/etc/shadow" or fd.name = "/etc/passwd")
  output: "Sensitive file accessed (user=%user.name file=%fd.name command=%proc.cmdline)"
  priority: WARNING
  tags: [filesystem, sensitive]
```

Save this rule in a new file, e.g., `custom_rules.yaml`.

##### Step 3: Apply the Custom Rule
Mount the custom rules file into the Falco container by editing the Helm deployment:
```yaml
extraVolumes:
  - name: custom-rules
    configMap:
      name: custom-rules
extraVolumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /etc/falco/rules.d/custom_rules.yaml
    name: custom-rules
```

Reload Falco to apply the rules:
```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment falco -n falco
```

---

#### 4. Testing Falco

##### Step 1: Trigger a Threat
Run a container and access a sensitive file:
```bash
kubectl run test-container --image=alpine --restart=Never -- sleep 1000
kubectl exec -it test-container -- cat /etc/shadow
```

##### Step 2: View Falco Alerts
Check the Falco logs for alerts:
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=falco -n falco
```

Example output:
```
Sensitive file accessed (user=root file=/etc/shadow command=cat /etc/shadow)
```

### Best Practices for Runtime Security

1. **Enable Kubernetes Audit Logs:**  
   - Monitor API server events to detect suspicious activity.  

2. **Write Specific Custom Rules:**  
   - Tailor Falco rules to the unique security requirements of your cluster.  

3. **Regularly Review Alerts:**  
   - Continuously monitor Falco alerts and tune rules to reduce noise.  

4. **Integrate with Notification Systems:**  
   - Send Falco alerts to Slack, PagerDuty, or other systems for real-time monitoring.  

5. **Combine Runtime Security with CI/CD:**  
   - Implement security checks at every stage of the software lifecycle.
