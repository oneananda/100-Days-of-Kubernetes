# Explaination of `my-config-map.yaml`

This YAML configuration is used to define a **ConfigMap** in Kubernetes (K8s). 

- **apiVersion: v1**: This specifies the version of the Kubernetes API that you are using. In this case, it is version `v1`, which is the most common for core Kubernetes resources like ConfigMaps.

- **kind: ConfigMap**: This specifies the type of Kubernetes resource being defined. In this case, it's a `ConfigMap`, which is used to store configuration data in key-value pairs.

- **metadata**:
  - **name: my-config-map**: This specifies the name of the ConfigMap. In this case, it's named `my-config-map`. The name is used to reference this ConfigMap from other resources in the Kubernetes cluster.

- **data**: This is the section where the actual configuration data is stored. It contains key-value pairs that can be used in your application. In this case, the data includes:
  - **APP_COLOR: "red"**: A key-value pair where `APP_COLOR` is set to `"red"`. This might indicate the color theme of the app.
  - **APP_MODE: "development"**: Another key-value pair where `APP_MODE` is set to `"development"`, indicating the environment mode the app is running in (e.g., development, staging, or production).
  - **MAX_RETRIES: "5"**: A key-value pair where `MAX_RETRIES` is set to `"5"`, which could be the number of retries an app should attempt in case of failure.

This ConfigMap is useful when you need to inject configuration values into your containers or applications running in Kubernetes. It provides a way to manage environment-specific settings separate from application code.
