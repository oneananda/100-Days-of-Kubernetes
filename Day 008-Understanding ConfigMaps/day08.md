## Day 8: Understanding ConfigMaps for External Configuration

### 📘 Overview

**ConfigMaps** in Kubernetes provide a way to store and manage non-sensitive configuration data, allowing you to keep configuration separate from application code. This flexibility makes applications more portable and easier to manage, especially when working with multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

### What is a ConfigMap?

A **ConfigMap** is an API object that allows you to store configuration data as key-value pairs. This data can then be injected into Pods as environment variables, command-line arguments, or configuration files. ConfigMaps make it easy to update application settings without rebuilding or redeploying the application.

### Key Features of ConfigMaps

1. **Environment-Agnostic Configurations**: Store configuration data separately from code, making it easier to manage across environments.
2. **Flexible Usage**: Inject configuration as environment variables, files, or command-line arguments.
3. **Centralized Management**: Update configuration in a centralized ConfigMap without modifying the application code or image.
