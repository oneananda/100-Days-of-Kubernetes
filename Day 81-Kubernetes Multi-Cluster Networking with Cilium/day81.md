## Day 81: Kubernetes Multi-Cluster Networking with Cilium

### 📘 Overview

Cilium is a powerful networking and security tool for Kubernetes based on **eBPF** (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter). It provides efficient networking, advanced observability, and robust security for multi-cluster environments. This session focuses on setting up multi-cluster connectivity using Cilium, leveraging eBPF for advanced networking, and implementing observability and security best practices.
