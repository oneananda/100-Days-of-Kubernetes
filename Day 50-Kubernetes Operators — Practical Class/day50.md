## Day 50: Kubernetes Operators — Practical Class

### 📘 Overview

**Kubernetes Operators** extend the capabilities of Kubernetes by managing complex applications and automating their lifecycle tasks. Operators are built using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Controllers, making it easier to manage stateful and custom applications in Kubernetes.

This session focuses on creating and deploying a simple Operator, understanding its architecture, and managing resources using CRDs.

### Objectives

1. Understand the purpose and architecture of Kubernetes Operators.
2. Create a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for a custom application.
3. Deploy and test a simple Operator.
4. Manage the application lifecycle using the Operator.

### Key Concepts

1. **Operators**:
   - Software extensions that automate the management of complex applications on Kubernetes.
   - Implement domain-specific knowledge via Controllers.

2. **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**:
   - Define custom resources in Kubernetes, extending its API to manage new types of resources.

3. **Controller**:
   - Watches the custom resources and takes action to reconcile the desired state.

4. **Operator Lifecycle**:
   - Automates tasks such as deployment, scaling, upgrades, and backups for applications.
