## Day 55: Kubernetes Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana — Practical Class

### 📘 Overview

Effective monitoring is essential for managing Kubernetes clusters. **Prometheus** is an open-source monitoring system that collects and stores metrics, while **Grafana** is a visualization tool used to analyze and display those metrics. Together, they provide a powerful monitoring solution for Kubernetes.

This session focuses on setting up Prometheus and Grafana, integrating them with Kubernetes, and creating dashboards to monitor cluster health.

### Objectives

1. Understand the purpose and functionality of Prometheus and Grafana in Kubernetes monitoring.
2. Install and configure Prometheus and Grafana in a Kubernetes cluster.
3. Collect metrics from Kubernetes components.
4. Visualize the metrics using Grafana dashboards.

### Key Concepts

1. **Prometheus**:
   - A time-series database that scrapes metrics from monitored services.
   - Uses a pull-based model for metric collection.
   - Provides a powerful query language (PromQL) for analyzing metrics.

2. **Grafana**:
   - A visualization tool for creating and sharing dashboards.
   - Supports various data sources, including Prometheus.
   - Enables alerting and collaboration on metrics.

3. **Kubernetes Metrics**:
   - Includes resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, etc.), pod health, node health, and more.
   - Metrics are exposed by Kubernetes components like the kubelet and cAdvisor.

4. **Prometheus Operator**:
   - Simplifies the deployment and management of Prometheus in Kubernetes.
