## Day 92: Kubernetes Multi-Cluster Federation with Submariner

### 📘 Overview

In today's session, you'll learn how to connect isolated Kubernetes clusters using **Submariner**—an open-source tool designed to enable seamless cross-cluster networking. Submariner simplifies the federation of clusters by establishing secure, encrypted tunnels between them, allowing services and workloads to communicate as if they were part of a single, unified network. This session covers installing and configuring Submariner, managing cross-cluster communication, and implementing security best practices for multi-cluster environments.
