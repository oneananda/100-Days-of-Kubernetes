## Day 92: Kubernetes Multi-Cluster Federation with Submariner

### 📘 Overview

In today's session, you'll learn how to connect isolated Kubernetes clusters using **Submariner**—an open-source tool designed to enable seamless cross-cluster networking. Submariner simplifies the federation of clusters by establishing secure, encrypted tunnels between them, allowing services and workloads to communicate as if they were part of a single, unified network. This session covers installing and configuring Submariner, managing cross-cluster communication, and implementing security best practices for multi-cluster environments.

### Objectives

1. **Connect Isolated Clusters:**  
   - Deploy Submariner to federate multiple Kubernetes clusters across different networks.
   
2. **Manage Cross-Cluster Communication:**  
   - Configure service discovery and routing to enable seamless inter-cluster communication.
   
3. **Secure Multi-Cluster Networks:**  
   - Implement security measures such as encrypted tunnels and network policies to safeguard cross-cluster traffic.
