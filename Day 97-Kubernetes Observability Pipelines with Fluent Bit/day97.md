## Day 97: Kubernetes Observability Pipelines with Fluent Bit

### 📘 Overview

Efficient log management is vital for monitoring and troubleshooting in Kubernetes environments. **Fluent Bit** is a lightweight and high-performance log processor and forwarder designed to collect, filter, and transform logs from Kubernetes clusters. In this session, you'll learn how to set up Fluent Bit for log aggregation, apply filtering and transformation rules to streamline log data, and integrate with backend systems such as Elasticsearch, Loki, or Splunk for storage and analysis.

### Objectives

1. **Set Up Fluent Bit for Log Aggregation:**  
   - Deploy Fluent Bit in your Kubernetes cluster to collect logs from various sources.

2. **Filter and Transform Logs:**  
   - Apply rules to filter out noise and transform log data for better readability and relevance before forwarding.

3. **Integrate with Backend Systems:**  
   - Configure Fluent Bit to send processed logs to Elasticsearch, Loki, or Splunk, enabling centralized observability and analysis.

### Key Concepts

1. **Log Aggregation:**  
   - Centralizing log data from multiple sources to streamline monitoring and troubleshooting.

2. **Fluent Bit:**  
   - A lightweight log processor that can collect, filter, and forward logs efficiently.
   - Supports various input plugins (tailing log files, Kubernetes metadata) and output plugins (Elasticsearch, Loki, Splunk).

3. **Filtering and Transformation:**  
   - Use built-in filters to parse, modify, and enrich logs, removing unwanted information and structuring data for analysis.

4. **Backend Integration:**  
   - Forward logs to systems like **Elasticsearch** for powerful search and analytics, **Loki** for log aggregation with Prometheus-style labels, or **Splunk** for enterprise-level log analysis.
