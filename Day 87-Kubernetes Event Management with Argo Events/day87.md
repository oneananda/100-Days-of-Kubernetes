## Day 87: Kubernetes Event Management with Argo Events

### 📘 Overview

Kubernetes event management is a critical component for building reactive systems and automating workflows. **Argo Events** is an event-driven framework that simplifies the process of creating sensors, triggers, and event sources within Kubernetes. This session explores the event-driven architecture enabled by Argo Events, guides you through configuring sensors and triggers, and demonstrates how to build workflows that respond to real-time events.

---

### Objectives

1. Understand the principles of event-driven architecture using Argo Events.  
2. Configure sensors, triggers, and event sources to capture and process events in Kubernetes.  
3. Build and execute workflows that respond to real-time events effectively.

---

### Key Concepts

1. **Event-Driven Architecture:**  
   - A design paradigm where services react to events (changes in state) rather than polling for changes.  
   - Enhances scalability and responsiveness in distributed systems.

2. **Argo Events:**  
   - An open-source framework that enables event-driven automation on Kubernetes.
   - Consists of three core components:
     - **Event Sources:** Define where events originate (e.g., GitHub, S3, cron jobs).
     - **Sensors:** Listen for specific events and determine if the criteria to trigger a workflow are met.
     - **Triggers:** Actions that are executed when a sensor detects an event, such as launching a Kubernetes job or workflow.

3. **Workflow Automation:**  
   - Building automated processes that execute tasks based on events, improving efficiency and reducing manual intervention.

### Practical Exercises: Implementing Argo Events

---

#### 1. Installing Argo Events

##### Step 1: Deploy Argo Events Controller and Sensor
Install Argo Events components using the provided manifests:
```bash
kubectl create namespace argo-events
kubectl apply -n argo-events -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-events/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n argo-events
```

---

#### 2. Configuring an Event Source

##### Step 1: Create an Event Source Definition
Define a simple event source (e.g., a webhook) that listens for HTTP POST requests:
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: EventSource
metadata:
  name: webhook-event-source
  namespace: argo-events
spec:
  webhook:
    example:
      endpoint: /payload
      port: "12000"
```

Apply the event source:
```bash
kubectl apply -f webhook-event-source.yaml
```

---

#### 3. Setting Up a Sensor and Trigger

##### Step 1: Define a Sensor to Listen for Events
Create a sensor that triggers a workflow when an event is received:
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Sensor
metadata:
  name: webhook-sensor
  namespace: argo-events
spec:
  dependencies:
    - name: webhook-dep
      eventSourceName: webhook-event-source
      eventName: example
  triggers:
    - template:
        name: argo-trigger
        argoWorkflow:
          group: argoproj.io
          version: v1alpha1
          resource: workflows
          operation: submit
          source:
            resource:
              apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
              kind: Workflow
              metadata:
                generateName: triggered-workflow-
              spec:
                entrypoint: whalesay
                templates:
                  - name: whalesay
                    container:
                      image: docker/whalesay:latest
                      command: ["cowsay"]
                      args: ["Hello from Argo Events!"]
```

Apply the sensor:
```bash
kubectl apply -f webhook-sensor.yaml
```

---

#### 4. Testing the Event Workflow

##### Step 1: Send a Test Event
Trigger the webhook by sending an HTTP POST request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://<NODE_IP>:12000/payload -d '{}'
```

##### Step 2: Verify Workflow Execution
Check if the Argo workflow was triggered:
```bash
kubectl get wf -n argo-events
```

Inspect the logs of the workflow to ensure the correct execution:
```bash
argo logs <workflow-name> -n argo-events
```
