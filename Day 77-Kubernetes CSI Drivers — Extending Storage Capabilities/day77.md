## Day 77: Kubernetes CSI Drivers — Extending Storage Capabilities

### 📘 Overview

The **Container Storage Interface (CSI)** is a standard that allows Kubernetes to integrate with external storage systems through custom storage drivers. CSI enables dynamic volume provisioning, making it easier to use cloud and on-premises storage solutions. This session explores CSI, how to install and configure custom CSI drivers, and how to enable dynamic volume provisioning for external storage systems.

### Objectives

1. Understand the Container Storage Interface (CSI) and its role in Kubernetes storage.  
2. Install and configure custom CSI drivers in Kubernetes.  
3. Use CSI drivers for dynamic volume provisioning with external storage systems.

### Key Concepts

1. **Container Storage Interface (CSI):**  
   - A standardized API for container orchestrators to interact with storage systems.  
   - Enables Kubernetes to support third-party storage solutions seamlessly.  

2. **Dynamic Volume Provisioning:**  
   - Automates the creation and deletion of storage volumes as needed by workloads.  

3. **Custom CSI Drivers:**  
   - Allow integration with external storage systems like Amazon EBS, Azure Disk, and NFS.  

4. **StorageClass:**  
   - Defines storage provisioner settings, parameters, and policies for dynamic provisioning.
