## Day 34: Kubernetes StatefulSets — Managing Stateful Applications (Practical Class)

### 📘 Overview

**StatefulSets** in Kubernetes are used to manage stateful applications, ensuring predictable and stable pod identities, persistent storage, and ordered deployment. This practical session focuses on deploying and managing StatefulSets for stateful workloads like databases and distributed systems.

---


### Objectives

1. Understand the role of StatefulSets in Kubernetes.
2. Deploy and manage a StatefulSet with persistent storage.
3. Explore scaling and updates in StatefulSets.
4. Learn best practices for managing stateful workloads.

### Key Concepts

1. **Pod Identity**:
   - Pods in a StatefulSet have a unique, stable identity and hostname.

2. **Stable Storage**:
   - Persistent storage is associated with each pod and remains even after the pod is deleted.

3. **Ordered Deployment**:
   - Pods are created, updated, or deleted in a defined order.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - Databases, distributed file systems, and applications requiring stable network identities.
