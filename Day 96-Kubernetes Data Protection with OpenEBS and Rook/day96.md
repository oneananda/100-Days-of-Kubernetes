## Day 96: Kubernetes Data Protection with OpenEBS and Rook

### 📘 Overview

Ensuring robust data protection is critical in a Kubernetes environment. This session focuses on two powerful storage solutions: **OpenEBS** for container-attached storage and **Rook** for managing scalable Ceph clusters. You'll learn how to deploy these solutions, implement dynamic provisioning, and manage snapshots to safeguard persistent data, thus enabling resilient stateful applications.

### Objectives

1. **Deploy OpenEBS:**  
   - Set up OpenEBS to provide container-attached storage for stateful applications in Kubernetes.

2. **Manage Scalable Storage with Rook:**  
   - Deploy and manage Ceph clusters using Rook to create scalable, resilient storage pools.

3. **Implement Dynamic Provisioning and Snapshot Management:**  
   - Enable automated provisioning of persistent volumes.
   - Configure snapshot mechanisms to protect and restore data as needed.

### Key Concepts

1. **OpenEBS:**  
   - A container-attached storage solution designed specifically for Kubernetes.
   - Offers different storage engines (e.g., cStor, Jiva) that can be tailored to various performance and reliability needs.

2. **Rook:**  
   - A Kubernetes operator that simplifies deploying and managing Ceph clusters.
   - Provides scalable, fault-tolerant storage with dynamic provisioning capabilities.

3. **Dynamic Provisioning and Snapshots:**  
   - **Dynamic Provisioning:** Automates the creation of persistent volumes based on StorageClass definitions.
   - **Snapshot Management:** Enables point-in-time backups of persistent volumes to safeguard against data loss and facilitate recovery.
