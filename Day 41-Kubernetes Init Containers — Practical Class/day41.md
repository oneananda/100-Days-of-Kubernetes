## Day 41: Kubernetes Init Containers — Practical Class

### 📘 Overview

**Init Containers** are specialized containers that run before the main application container in a pod starts. They are ideal for performing setup tasks, such as configuration, environment preparation, or dependencies checks, before starting the main container.

This session focuses on understanding Init Containers, configuring them in a pod, and testing their behavior.

### Objectives

1. Understand the role and purpose of Init Containers in Kubernetes.
2. Create and configure Init Containers in a pod.
3. Test the execution flow of Init Containers and main containers.
4. Use Init Containers for setup and validation tasks.

### Key Concepts

1. **Init Containers**:
   - Run sequentially before the main application container starts.
   - Ideal for initialization tasks like downloading files, setting environment variables, or running checks.

2. **Execution Flow**:
   - Init Containers must complete successfully before the main container starts.
   - Each Init Container runs to completion in the order specified.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - Preparing or validating data.
   - Ensuring dependencies are met.
   - Setting up directories or files for the main container.
