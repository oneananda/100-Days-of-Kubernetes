## Day 95: Kubernetes High Availability and Resilience

### 📘 Overview

High availability (HA) and resilience are critical for ensuring that your Kubernetes clusters can withstand failures and continue to operate seamlessly. In this session, you'll learn how to design highly available Kubernetes clusters, configure the control plane and etcd for HA, and test the resilience of your setup under various failure scenarios. This hands-on approach will prepare you to build robust clusters that minimize downtime and maintain service continuity.

### Objectives

1. **Design Highly Available Clusters:**  
   - Understand architectural best practices for achieving high availability in Kubernetes deployments.
   
2. **Configure HA for Control Plane and etcd:**  
   - Learn to set up redundant control plane nodes and secure the etcd data store to ensure continuity and reliability.
   
3. **Test Resilience Under Failures:**  
   - Execute failure simulations and observe cluster behavior to validate your HA configurations and resilience strategies.

### Key Concepts

1. **High Availability (HA):**  
   - Designing systems that remain operational even when some components fail.
   - In Kubernetes, this involves multiple control plane nodes and a fault-tolerant etcd cluster.

2. **Control Plane Redundancy:**  
   - Distributing API server, scheduler, and controller-manager across multiple nodes.
   - Utilizing load balancers to distribute requests among control plane nodes.

3. **etcd Resilience:**  
   - Configuring etcd as a clustered data store with quorum-based replication.
   - Regular backups and proper resource allocation to safeguard cluster state.

4. **Failure Testing:**  
   - Simulating component failures to assess the effectiveness of HA configurations.
   - Tools and techniques for chaos testing and disaster recovery validation.
