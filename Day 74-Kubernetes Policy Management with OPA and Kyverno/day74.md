## Day 74: Kubernetes Policy Management with OPA and Kyverno

### 📘 Overview

Policy management is crucial for enforcing security, compliance, and operational standards in Kubernetes clusters. Tools like **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** and **Kyverno** enable administrators to define, enforce, and automate policies for workloads and cluster resources. This session explores OPA and Kyverno, their differences, and how to write and automate custom policies for compliance and security.

---


### Objectives

1. Compare **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** and **Kyverno** for Kubernetes policy management.  
2. Learn to write and enforce custom policies for security and compliance.  
3. Automate policy enforcement in CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent cluster configurations.

### Key Concepts

1. **Open Policy Agent (OPA):**  
   - General-purpose policy engine using **Rego** as its policy language.  
   - Integrates with Kubernetes via **Gatekeeper** for dynamic policy enforcement.  

2. **Kyverno:**  
   - Kubernetes-native policy engine that uses declarative YAML for policies.  
   - Simpler to use for Kubernetes-specific policies, with built-in CRDs for validation, mutation, and generation.  

3. **Policy Categories:**  
   - **Validation:** Ensures workloads meet security and compliance requirements.  
   - **Mutation:** Automatically modifies resource specifications.  
   - **Generation:** Creates additional resources based on existing configurations.
