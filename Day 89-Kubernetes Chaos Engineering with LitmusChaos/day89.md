## Day 89: Kubernetes Chaos Engineering with LitmusChaos

### 📘 Overview

Chaos engineering is a proactive approach to uncover hidden vulnerabilities by intentionally injecting failures into your Kubernetes environment. **LitmusChaos** is an open-source chaos engineering framework that allows you to simulate real-world failure scenarios, test your application resilience, and improve system behavior under stress. In this session, you will set up LitmusChaos, run various chaos experiments, and analyze the outcomes to enhance your cluster's robustness.

---

### Objectives

1. **Setup LitmusChaos:** Learn how to install and configure LitmusChaos for chaos testing in your Kubernetes cluster.
2. **Run Chaos Experiments:** Execute targeted experiments to simulate failure scenarios and test application resilience.
3. **Observe and Improve:** Analyze system behavior during experiments and implement improvements based on observed data.

---

### Key Concepts

1. **Chaos Engineering:**  
   - The discipline of intentionally injecting failures into a system to expose weaknesses and validate resilience.

2. **LitmusChaos:**  
   - A comprehensive framework for orchestrating chaos experiments in Kubernetes.
   - Offers pre-defined experiments such as pod deletion, network partitioning, and node failures.

3. **Resilience Testing:**  
   - The process of assessing how an application reacts to disruptions, identifying bottlenecks, and validating recovery mechanisms.

4. **System Observability:**  
   - Monitoring and logging tools used to evaluate system behavior under stress, providing insights for improvements.

### Practical Exercises: Chaos Engineering with LitmusChaos

#### 1. Setting Up LitmusChaos

##### Step 1: Install LitmusChaos in Your Cluster
Create a dedicated namespace for LitmusChaos and deploy its components:
```bash
kubectl create namespace litmus
kubectl apply -f https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-operator-v1.13.8.yaml -n litmus
```

Verify that the LitmusChaos pods are running:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n litmus
```

##### Step 2: (Optional) Deploy the LitmusChaos Dashboard
For a visual interface to monitor your chaos experiments:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-dashboard.yaml -n litmus
```

---

#### 2. Running Chaos Experiments

##### Step 1: Select and Deploy a Chaos Experiment
For example, run a pod delete experiment to simulate sudden pod failures. Apply the experiment manifest:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/1.13.8?file=charts/generic/pod-delete/experiment.yaml -n litmus
```

##### Step 2: Customize the Experiment Parameters
Edit the experiment YAML to target specific applications:
```yaml
spec:
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=my-application"
    appkind: "deployment"
```
Save the customized file as `custom-pod-delete-experiment.yaml` and apply:
```bash
kubectl apply -f custom-pod-delete-experiment.yaml -n litmus
```

##### Step 3: Monitor the Chaos Experiment
Track the status and results of your experiment:
```bash
kubectl get chaosresult -n litmus
kubectl logs -f <chaos-runner-pod> -n litmus
```

---

#### 3. Observing and Improving System Behavior

##### Step 1: Analyze Metrics and Logs
After executing the experiments, review your monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana) to analyze:
- Pod recovery times
- Error rates and log messages
- Impact on application performance

##### Step 2: Identify and Implement Improvements
Based on your analysis:
- **Adjust Deployment Strategies:** Scale replicas, fine-tune resource limits, and implement robust health checks.
- **Introduce Fallback Mechanisms:** Consider circuit breakers or redundancy strategies.
- **Document Findings:** Record insights and update your chaos experiments to cover additional scenarios.
