## Day 89: Kubernetes Chaos Engineering with LitmusChaos

### 📘 Overview

Chaos engineering is a proactive approach to uncover hidden vulnerabilities by intentionally injecting failures into your Kubernetes environment. **LitmusChaos** is an open-source chaos engineering framework that allows you to simulate real-world failure scenarios, test your application resilience, and improve system behavior under stress. In this session, you will set up LitmusChaos, run various chaos experiments, and analyze the outcomes to enhance your cluster's robustness.

### Objectives

1. **Setup LitmusChaos:** Learn how to install and configure LitmusChaos for chaos testing in your Kubernetes cluster.
2. **Run Chaos Experiments:** Execute targeted experiments to simulate failure scenarios and test application resilience.
3. **Observe and Improve:** Analyze system behavior during experiments and implement improvements based on observed data.

### Key Concepts

1. **Chaos Engineering:**  
   - The discipline of intentionally injecting failures into a system to expose weaknesses and validate resilience.

2. **LitmusChaos:**  
   - A comprehensive framework for orchestrating chaos experiments in Kubernetes.
   - Offers pre-defined experiments such as pod deletion, network partitioning, and node failures.

3. **Resilience Testing:**  
   - The process of assessing how an application reacts to disruptions, identifying bottlenecks, and validating recovery mechanisms.

4. **System Observability:**  
   - Monitoring and logging tools used to evaluate system behavior under stress, providing insights for improvements.
