## Day 38: Kubernetes Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana — Practical Class

### 📘 Overview

Monitoring is essential for understanding the health, performance, and usage of Kubernetes clusters and workloads. **Prometheus** is a popular open-source monitoring tool that collects and stores metrics, while **Grafana** provides visualization capabilities for Prometheus metrics.

This practical session focuses on setting up Prometheus and Grafana to monitor Kubernetes clusters and workloads.

### Objectives

1. Understand how Prometheus and Grafana work in Kubernetes.
2. Deploy Prometheus and Grafana in a Kubernetes cluster.
3. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the cluster.
4. Use Grafana to create dashboards and visualize metrics.

### Key Concepts

1. **Prometheus**:
   - Collects and stores time-series data.
   - Uses a pull-based model to scrape metrics from exporters and Kubernetes objects.

2. **Grafana**:
   - Provides dashboards and visualization tools for Prometheus metrics.
   - Integrates with Prometheus and other data sources.

3. **Node Exporter**:
   - Collects node-level metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage.

4. **Kube-State-Metrics**:
   - Provides detailed metrics on Kubernetes resources like pods, deployments, and nodes.
