## Day 51: Kubernetes Stateful Applications with Operators — Practical Class

### 📘 Overview

While Operators are powerful for managing Kubernetes workloads, they shine when applied to **stateful applications** like databases or distributed systems. Stateful applications require specific handling for persistence, ordering, and scaling, which can be effectively managed with a Kubernetes Operator.

This session focuses on deploying a stateful application (e.g., MySQL) using a custom Operator to manage its lifecycle.

### Objectives

1. Understand the challenges of running stateful applications in Kubernetes.
2. Deploy a StatefulSet for persistence and ordered deployment.
3. Extend StatefulSet functionality with a custom Operator.
4. Manage the stateful application lifecycle with the Operator.

### Key Concepts

1. **Stateful Applications**:
   - Require persistent storage and consistent networking.
   - Need ordered startup, scaling, and termination.

2. **StatefulSets**:
   - Kubernetes resource designed for managing stateful applications.
   - Ensures predictable pod identities and persistent storage.

3. **Operators for Stateful Applications**:
   - Automate tasks like scaling, backup, and recovery for stateful workloads.
   - Provide domain-specific management logic.
